<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<br>

This is it, the project I always wanted to proudly present to the world. This took me more than 3 months of coding, searching, reading documentation, watching lots of tutorials. I wanted to build something unique. During the building proccess, I hit many roadblock, but every roadblock taught me something new.<br>
Below I listed some of the key features I think are great about this project.

### Feature:

- Run in command-line interface(CLI) and install it on your machine
- Friendly **VScode**-like editor with **auto Suggestion** and **syntax highlighting**. (fun fact: VScode and this editor uses the same library named Monaco)
- Document your code with a beautiful markdown editor
- **Autosave** to your hard drive
- Run the code automatically and preview the result
- You can open **multiple** code(+text) windows and they are **joined** with the previous code. Which means you can access a variable from the previous code window
- Import any **JS** (and **CS**) library directly. No installation is required!
- Built-in **Reactjs** support. No need to import 'react' and 'react-dom'
- Added a **show()** function, which can directly display jsx or, any js value.
- Rearrange the opened window with **'up'** and **'down'** arrow
- **Prettier** format button
- Auto generates a **.js** file on your hard drive. You can share it with anyone

I hope to add more features in the future. If you have any specific features in mind let me know. Or better yet you can add feature forking this project. To know how, see the **Contributing** sections.

### Built With

- [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org)
- [Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org)
- [React-Redux](https://react-redux.js.org) for state management
- [Expressjs](https://expressjs.com) for backend
- [Commander](https://npmjs.com/package/commander) for CLI
- [Monaco Library]()
- [Lerna]() for managing 3 different package

lots of other packages

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

This package is installable if you already installed nodejs on your system. Follow the instruction below to get started ‚è¨

### Prerequisites

> You have to have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) installed on your machine
> <br>

### Installation

1. Go to your preferred directory ex: c://\<folder-name>/
2. Open Command Interface of your choice. **ex**: _cmd_, _powershell_, _git-cli_ etc...
3. Run the following command to install mgnote globally
   ```sh
   npm i -g mgnote
   ```
   Now you can run mgnote anywhere in your machine.

### Don't want to install anything?

Run this instead for a quick run

```sh
npx mgnote serve
```

## Usage

To start using the app, enter the following command

```sh
mgnote serve
```

**That's it!** You will see a local server link in your cli. Copy and paste the link to the browser. Finally hit enter. You will see a beautiful website appeared on your screen.
<br>

<em>By default a file, named **notebook.js** will get created for you</em>
<br>

**you can optionally specify a port number (if default port is not available) and book name**

```sh
mgnote serve [file-name.js] [-p ****]
```

**example:**

```sh
mgnote serve mybook.js -p 3030
```

If you are done editing, you can share the file (**notebook.js** or, **mgnote** whatever) created in your chosen directory with the world\*

<br>

_or maybe you want to save some **JS function** or **React component** and document how they work.<br> **MG Note** got you covered!_
