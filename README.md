<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<img src='./demo/Demo.gif' align='center'>

This is it, the project I always wanted to proudly present to the world. This took me more than 3 months of coding, searching, reading documentation, watching lots of tutorial. I wanted to build something unique. During the building proccess I hit many road block, but every roadblock taught me something new.<br>
Below I listed some of the key feature I think great about this project.

### Feature:

- Run in command line interface(CLI) and install it on your machine
- Friendly **VScode** like editor with **auto Suggestion** and **syntex highlighting**. (funfact: VScode and this editor uses same library named monaco)
- Document your code with beautiful markdown editor
- Auto **save** to your hard drive
- Run the code automatically and preview the result
- You can open **multiple** code(+text) windows and they are **joined** with previous code. Which means you can access variable from previous code window
- Import any **JS** (and **CS**) library directly. No installation required!
- Built-in **Reactjs** support. No need to import 'react' and 'react-dom'
- Added a **show()** function, which can directly display jsx or, any js value.
- Rearrange the opened window with **'up'** and **'down'** arrow
- **Prettier** format button
- Auto generate a **.js** file on your hard drive. You can share it with anyone

I hope to add more feature in the future. If you have any specific feature in mind let me know. Or better yet you can add feature forking this project. To know how, see the **Contributing** sections.

### Built With

- [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org)
- [Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org)

lots of other packages

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

> You have to have [node](https://nodejs.org) installed on your machine
> <br>

### Installation

1. Go to your prefered directory ex: c://\<folder-name>/
2. Open Command Interface of your choice. **ex**: _cmd_, _powershell_, _git-cli_ etc...
3. Run the following command to install mgnote globally
   ```sh
   npm i -g mgnote
   ```
   Now you can run mgcode anywhare in your machine.

### Don't want to install anything?

Run this instead for quick run

```sh
npx mgnote serve
```

## Usage

To start using the app, enter the following command

```sh
mgnote serve
```

**That's it!** You will see a local server link in your cli. Copy and paste the link to the browser. Finally hit enter. You will see a beautiful website appeard on your screen.
<br>

<em>By default a file, named **notebook.js** will get created for you</em>
<br>

**you can optionally specify a port number (if default one is not available) and book name**

```sh
mgnote serve [file-name] [-p ****]
```

**example:**

```sh
mgnote serve mybook -p 3030
```

If you are done editing, you can share the file (**notebook.js** or, **mgnote** whatever) created in your choosen directory with the world\*

<br>

_or maybe you want to save some **JS function** or **React component** and document how they work.<br> **MG Note** got you covered!_
